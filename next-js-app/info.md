As a Machine Learning Intern on the Data Science and Analytics global team, I leveraged cutting-edge AI and data engineering to develop and optimize intelligent systems, significantly enhancing customer experiences and driving substantial operational efficiencies. My work focused on transforming complex data into actionable insights and building scalable solutions that directly contributed to future revenue growth and cost savings.

- Spearheaded the development of an AI chatbot for dynamic product recommendations, enabling users to "speak to data" for over 12,000 active SKUs and processing hyper-specific queries by evaluating 150+ features. SKU parsing opened up many avenues - including but not limited to - Full live product searching, product data integrity enforcement, portfolio gap analysis, detailed product search for customers, and more.

- Developed a robust program to create a centralized SQLite reverse search index, normalizing complex product data from 30+ disparate databases (solving prior challenges of manual product discovery across inconsistent formats); this critical system is foundational for accurate customer query processing and successful AI operation.

- Designed and documented comprehensive Agentic AI implementation workflows, leveraging Google ADK, agentic tooling, and establishing MCP servers.

- Ideated a strategic AI cost-optimization layer utilizing vector databases over internal AI calls (including chatbots and coding assistants), projected to achieve a 45% reduction in token costs by intelligently querying existing data rather than generating new content.

- Contributed to customer facing chatbot projected to generate $1.5M in gross revenue and increase online customer conversion by 2%.

- Collaborated with Google's development team by providing critical bug reports and technical insights on the Google ADK, influencing product improvements and facilitating the adoption of cutting-edge Agentic AI tooling within internal projects.As a Machine Learning Intern on the Data Science and Analytics global team, I leveraged cutting-edge AI and data engineering to develop and optimize intelligent systems, significantly enhancing customer experiences and driving substantial operational efficiencies.

  As a member of the engineering and innovations team, I contributed to the modernization and reliability of critical transit systems through comprehensive testing, automation, and infrastructure enhancements.

- Engineered and executed over 200 comprehensive tests across 18 suites for a critical, statewide digital incident reporting system, achieving an exceptional 85% code coverage with Jest and Gherkin. This rigorous testing framework significantly accelerated the development lifecycle by enabling rapid, confident updates and enhancements, thereby guaranteeing the system's reliability and preventing unintended side effects for New Jersey Transit's vital operations.

- Integrated software tests directly into the CI/CD pipeline using Azure Pipelines, establishing an automated feedback loop that instantly identified test failures and pinpointed root causes for developers. This initiative dramatically reduced debugging time, proactively prevented issues from reaching production environments, and significantly streamlined the overall release process, enhancing development velocity and software quality across the board.

- Led the initiative to modernize and stabilize 127 legacy .NET projects, spanning from 2010 to 2023. Systematically assessed each project for functionality, upgrade feasibility, and potential vulnerabilities, proactively addressing security risks and technical debt. Developed comprehensive documentation for APIs, databases, issues, and libraries, significantly improving overall system stability, reducing technical debt, and enhancing future development efforts.

- Spearheaded efficiency gains by developing Python + Pandas scripts to automate the exhaustive information gathering process for 127 legacy C# .NET projects. This automation saved days of intensive manual effort, significantly accelerating the creation of high-quality, comprehensive documentation, and ensuring accuracy through streamlined verification processes.As a member of the engineering and innovations team, I contributed to the modernization and reliability of critical transit systems through comprehensive testing, automation, and infrastructure enhancements. - Engineered and executed over 200 comprehensive tests across 18 suites for a critical, statewide digital incident reporting system, achieving an exceptional 85% code coverage with Jest and Gherkin.

Stunt CV is a desktop application designed for detailed analysis of acrobatic performances, such as cheer stunts and partner acrobatics. Using advanced computer vision, it tracks two performers, the “base” and “flyer” - providing both visual feedback and exportable performance data.

Key Features:

- Dual-Person Tracking: Automatically detects two main performers or allows manual ROI selection for precision.

- Pose Estimation: Leverages MediaPipe Pose to map 33 key body landmarks for each performer.

- Smoothing Filters: Reduces jitter for cleaner motion analysis.

- Multi-View Interface: View the original footage, pose overlays with interactive controls, and mocap-only skeleton views.

- Export Options: Save processed videos (with overlays or mocap-only) and export detailed pose data (x, y, z, visibility) to CSV for external analysis.

Applications:

- Performance review & coaching feedback
- Movement research & biomechanics studies
- Data-driven performance optimization

Tech Stack: Python, OpenCV, MediaPipe, Tkinter, NumPy, Pillow

Future development will introduce deeper analytics (joint angles, velocity, acceleration), keyframe tagging, and enhanced automatic tracking for complex movement scenarios.

With Stunt CV, coaches, athletes, and researchers can turn performance footage into actionable insights, bridging the gap between visual review and quantitative motion analysis.Stunt CV is a desktop application designed for detailed analysis of acrobatic performances, such as cheer stunts and partner acrobatics.
